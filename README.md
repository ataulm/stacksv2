Can be used as a skeleton for new spikes. Don't modify this project except to update dependencies; checkout from the latest master.

It would be good to fill this out before starting the spike and with updates before each push if necessary:

#### Aim
_e.g. wanted to try to create a completely virtual view hierarchy, so there's nothing really there on screen but an accessibility service like TalkBack could navigate it and a user proficient with TalkBack could use the app_

#### Current state (inc. next steps if applicable)
_e.g. completed - see blahblah.kt for main bits._
